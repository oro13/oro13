### Hey there, I'm Feli ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜„ 

I'm a data scientist, machine learning engineer, and practioner/evangelist of Bayesian statistics.

#### Current Projects:

Working on a team for consulting the City of Seattle on road safety. We're using machine learning predictive models and statistical modeling analyze traffic collision data. I'm using Bayesian decision theory to make policy recommendations based on our findings and optimizing for efficient use of city resources. Check it out [here](https://github.com/DataCircles/traffic_collisions_ml_team1)! 

I'm compiling and creating learning resources for Bayesian data analysis and science, called the [Bayesian Mixtape](https://github.com/oro13/bayesian-mixtape)

I contribute to numerous opensource projects, including [Holo-REA](https://github.com/holo-rea/holo-rea) for a post-blockchain operations/accounting library.

#### Recent Projects

I've also contributed to a variety of ML prototypes including a [language learning app](https://github.com/oro13/language-app-ml), a [soil nutrition predictor](https://github.com/oro13/soil-health-prediction), [auction price predictions](https://github.com/oro13/a-bulldozer-named-desire/), [fraudulent activity detection dashboard](https://github.com/oro13/fraud-detection), user specific content recommenders, NLP analysis, ecommerce, and so on.

#### Tools:

- sklearn
- tensorflow
- tensorflow probability
- gradient boosting (xgboost, catboost, lightgbm)

Javascript

- vue.js
- typescript
- tensorflow.js
- d3.js

Rust
